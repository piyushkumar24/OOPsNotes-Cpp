# üìò Chapter 10: Static Keyword in C++

---

## üîç Overview

The `static` keyword in C++ is a powerful feature that controls **lifetime**, **scope**, and **memory sharing** of variables and objects. This chapter dives deep into how `static` affects:
- Local variables inside functions
- Member variables inside classes
- Object lifetimes
- Memory management in OOP

Understanding `static` is crucial for writing optimized and bug-free C++ code, especially in object-oriented scenarios.
