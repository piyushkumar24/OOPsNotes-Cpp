## 💡 Why This Exists?

While diving into OOP in C++, I noticed that many tutorials rush through with syntax or vague metaphors. This series builds understanding from **first principles** and emphasizes:

- The *why* behind OOP features like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Deep analogies and real-world examples
- Code snippets that reinforce theory
- Interview-centric explanations without being dry

It’s a curated blend of my handwritten notes, project learnings, and revision insights — now completed and open for everyone.
